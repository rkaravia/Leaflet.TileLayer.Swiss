# Swisstopo map tile service and terms of use

This plugin uses Swisstopo base maps and other datasets available through Swisstopo's Web Map Tile Service (WMTS).

Technically, this means that small square images are loaded from Swisstopo servers. Careful observers will notice
requests to URLs starting with `https://wmts{n}.geo.admin.ch` in their browser developer tools.

Since 2021-03-01, this data is available for free under an open license as part of Swisstopo's
[Open Government Data (OGD)](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/swisstopo/free-geodata.html) strategy.
Please note that the following terms apply:

- [OGD terms of use](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/home/meta/conditions/geodata/ogd.html)
- [General terms of use](https://www.geo.admin.ch/en/geo-services/geo-services/terms-of-use.html), in particular "fair use" of _wmts.geo.admin.ch_

<code>Â© <a href="https://www.swisstopo.ch/">Swisstopo</a></code> is added below the map by this plugin by default in order to comply with the OGD terms of use.
